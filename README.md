# FileFixer
Two batch scripts that allow a directory of files to be prefixed.

The add_prefix.bat prepends a string to all of the files in a given directory.
The remove_prefix.bat removes a string from all of the files in a given directory. 

The syntax:

CD to the directory where the add_prefix.bat is.
C:\castle_prefixia>add_prefix.bat "D:\Dropbox\sites\Ruffel-Brown\products\1Hunter Douglas\9Roman Shades\Vignette" "HD_RS_V_"

This will go to the directory and prepend all of the files with the "HD_RS_V_" string. 
My use case for this: I am uploading a number of files to a WordPress site and I want to keep all of the naming sensible otherwise, I may be fighting with 20 files uploaded a "1Hero.jpg"
